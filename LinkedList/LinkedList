LinkedList:

In Java, LinkedList is another implementation of the List interface provided by the Java Collections Framework. 
It's part of the java.util package. Unlike ArrayList, which is backed by an array, LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-linked list.



Key features and characteristics of LinkedList:

->Internal Structure: LinkedList utilizes a doubly linked list internally for element storage, facilitating efficient insertion and deletion operations.

->Data Manipulation: LinkedList excels in data manipulation tasks due to its efficient insertion and removal operations.

->List and Queue Operations: The LinkedList class can serve as both a list and a queue, as it implements both the List and Deque interfaces.

->Performance Advantage: Manipulating elements in a LinkedList tends to be faster compared to ArrayList due to its employment of a doubly linked list structure, 
  eliminating the need for bit shifting in memory operations.

->Optimal Use Cases: LinkedList is ideal for scenarios where frequent addition and removal of items occurs at the beginning or middle of the list, and where random access to elements is not essential.
