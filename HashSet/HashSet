HashSet:

In Java, HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface provided by the Java Collections Framework. It's part of the java.util package.

Key features and characteristics of HashSet:

->Support for Null Values: HashSet permits null values within its collection.

->Hashing Mechanism: Elements in a HashSet are organized and stored based on a hashing mechanism, optimizing insertion, deletion, and search operations.

->Non-Synchronized Implementation: HashSet is a non-synchronized class, meaning it's not inherently thread-safe and requires external synchronization for concurrent access.

->Hash Code-based Element Management: Elements within a HashSet are inserted and identified using their respective hash codes, facilitating efficient retrieval and manipulation.

->Unique Element Constraint: HashSet enforces uniqueness among its elements, ensuring no duplicate elements within the collection.

->Primarily Suited for Search Operations: HashSet is particularly advantageous for search operations due to its constant-time complexity for basic operations, such as retrieval and verification of element existence.

->Default Capacity and Load Factor: By default, HashSet initializes with a capacity of 16 and a load factor of 0.75, which can be adjusted as needed to optimize performance and memory usage.

->Hash Table Data Structure: HashSet utilizes the hash table data structure internally to manage its elements efficiently, supporting rapid access and modification operations.
