/*Polymorphism: Polymorphism means "many forms." 
 * It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
 * The most common use of polymorphism is method overriding, 
 * where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.*/
